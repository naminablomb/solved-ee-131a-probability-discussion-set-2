 <li>Two riflemen A and B are shooting at a target. Independently of who is shooting, the probability that the shot results in a hit is 0<em>.</em> Each shot is independent from others, and the riflemen shoot at the target one by one in the order A, B, A, B, … . What is the probability that A hits the target before B?</li>

 <li><em>Conditional Probability. </em>Problem 2.73, page 88 of ALG.

  <ul>

   <li>Find <em>P</em>(<em>A</em>|<em>B</em>) if <em>A </em>∩ <em>B </em>= ∅; if <em>A </em>⊂ <em>B</em>; if <em>A </em>⊃ <em>B</em>.</li>

   <li>Show that if <em>P</em>(<em>A</em>|<em>B</em>) <em>&gt; P</em>(<em>A</em>), then <em>P</em>(<em>B</em>|<em>A</em>) <em>&gt; P</em>(<em>B</em>).</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li><em>The Number of Children. </em>A family has j children with probability <em>p<sub>j</sub></em>, where <em>p</em><sub>1 </sub>= <em>.</em>1, <em>p</em><sub>2 </sub>= <em>.</em>25, <em>p</em><sub>3 </sub>= <em>.</em>35, <em>p</em><sub>4 </sub>= <em>.</em> A child from this family is randomly chosen. Given that this child is the eldest child in the family, find the conditional probability that the family has (a) only 1 child; (b) 4 children.</li>

 <li><em>Pairwise independence and overall independence. </em>Alice, Bob and Claire each throw a fair die once. Show that the events <em>A,B </em>and <em>C </em>where <em>A</em>: “Alice and Bob roll the same face”, <em>B</em>: “Alice and Claire roll the same face” and <em>C</em>: “Bob and Claire roll the same face” are pairwise independent but not independent.</li>

 <li>A binary Z-channel is show in the figure. Assume the input is “0” with probability <em>p </em>and “1” with probability 1 − <em>p</em>.</li>

<ul>

 <li>What can you say about the input bit if “1” is received?</li>

 <li>Find the the probability that the input was “1” given that the output is “0”.</li>
